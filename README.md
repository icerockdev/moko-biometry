All development (both new features and bug fixes) is performed in the `develop` branch. This way `master` always contains the sources of the most recently released version. Please send PRs with bug fixes to the `develop` branch. Documentation fixes in the markdown files are an exception to this rule. They are updated directly in `master`.

The `develop` branch is pushed to `master` on release.

For more details on contributing please see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
